* Notes on slides
** 1. Intro
** 2. "Social responsibility"
   - Russell-Einstein manifesto against nuclear weapons
   - Nuremberg trials, scientists sentenced to death for socially
     reprehensible actions
   - Environmental movement, slowly killing ourselves by pollution
** 3. The Ethic of Responsibility
   - Three imperatives
** 4. Doctrinal norm
   - Codes of ethics adopted by scientific organizations
   - Models of "good scientists": Einstein, Feynman, Sagan, etc.
** 5. The Ethic of Responsibility in Decline
   - Military work. (*Note LM*: how bad is it, really?)
   - Normative vision is nowadays considered inappropriate
   - Students, prospective scientists not considering social utility
** 6. Artifacts and Ideas are *Routinely* Political
   - Stingray device (cell tower spoofer)
   - Drone control stations
   - Phone monitoring software
   - Crypto should also be considered political

   *Note LM*: this also applies to non-crypto software and
    hardware. E.g. what if bugs in an Intel CPU are actually an NSA
    backdoor?
** 7. Perception of Cryptographers
   - "Spy", "hacker" versus Scientist
   - The latter doesn't *seem* political
** 8. Cryptographers Used to be More Political
   - Diffie, Newegg vs. TQP <-- on the social relevance of privacy
   - Chaum <-- on surveillance society

   *Note LM*: Has Chaum defected? His latest cMix paper is very
    controversial, suggests legitimizing backdoors.
** 9. Disciplinary Divide
   - Chaum: Untraceable electronic mail, considered "unrigorous"?
     Actually the paper's discourse is more *socio-political*.
   - Golwasser and Micali, Probabilistic encryption, discourse is more
     scientific, "harmless"?
** 10. Cypherpunks
   "The Universe believes in encryption" (Assange)
** 11. Cryptography doesn't always favour the weak
   - Identity-Based Encryption: requires a third-party for the scheme to
     work. What if the third-party becomes untrusted?

     *Note LM*: this seems to have the same problem as PKI.

     *Note LM*: Boneh and Franklin, IBE-based Pairing Based Cryptography
     solves this issue?
   - Fully Homomorphic Encryption, unicorns (at least from Rogaway's
     point of view)
   - *Note LM*: there are other technologies that put the user in a
     weaker position, e.g. ARM TrustZone, Intel SGX
** 12. The Summer of Snowden
   The question is, is mass surveillance even a problem?
** 13. Complexity + Secrecy: A Toxic Mix
   We don't know if, why, how we're tracked, a complete lack of
   transparency.
** 14. Law-Enforcement Framing
   Privacy and Security are in conflict --> there's a risk of "going
   dark" and of "terrorists" winning. Is there any credibility to this?

   *Note LM*: Reports of terrorists using Telegram to communicate.
** 15. Surveillance-Studies Framing
   Privacy and Security usually not in conflict, surveillance is an
   instrument of power used for cyber warfare.

   Privacy is also a social good, privacy and security support one
   another.
** 16. Political surveillance
   - Matin Luther King's fake suicide letter
   - Miami protests, people are monitored, in order to discourage
     protests, etc.
** 17. Instinctual Disdain
   Surveillance is a *prey* versus *predator* game.
** 18. Narayanan's taxonomy
   - Crypto-for-security: SSL et al.
   - Crypto-for-privacy: PGP, Tor
   - Crypto-for-crypto: "Crypto degeaba"

   *Note LM*: Author thinks SSL has done great over the years, which is
   dubious in light of vulnerabilities discovered in the last
   years. These seem to suggest that there were backdoors in there all
   along, planted by who-knows-who.
** 19. The xMail problem
   Problem formulation: A wants to send a message to B using an
   untrusted server.

   Scheme:
   - A encrypts data with B's public key
   - Server adds it to database
   - B receives its data from the server and decrypts it with their
     secret key

   Problem: in the worst case, B has to download the entire database
   from the server and traverse it to see if it has any messages.
** 20. Bigkey Cryptography
   Problem formulation: protect against Advanced Persistent
   Threats. Hide small data inside a big amount of data and encrypt it
   using a huge key (e.g. 1TB).
** 21. Bigkey Cryptography
   Problem: if a big enough proportion (e.g. 50%) of the big key is
   leaked, what is the adversary's probability of predicting a part of
   the key?
** 22. More examples and moral imperatives
   - Riposte, scrypt, various attacks, etc.
   - Imperatives:
     + Attend social value, do anti-surveillance research
     + Be introspective about why you're working on a problem
** 23. Practice-oriented provable security for crypto-for-privacy
   Current work has problems mentioned in the slide.

   Condemnatory attitude towards "non-standard" models.
** 24. Against Dogma
   "All models are wrong, but some are useful."

   Be open to diverse models. Regard all models as suspect and
   dialectial.
** 25. Military Funding - 1
   *Note LM*: what does the graph say about DoD funding? DoD gets more
   involved in crypto, but what is their motivation?
** 26. Military Funding - 2
   Funding *changes* our values. *Reflects* as values.

   *Note LM*: This also applies to corporate funding!
** 27. Military Funding - 3
   NSA doesn't consider crypto research a threat.

   - Think twice about accepting military funding
   - Regard ordinary people as those whose needs you aim to satisfy
** 28. Cute or Scary?
   Cartoon representations are unrealistic. Think about *human concerns*.

   - Stop cutesy pictures
   - Frustrate the NSA
** 29. More Suggestions
   - Academic freedom
   - Systems-level view

     *Note LM*: again, social responsibilities rests upon scientists,
     developers, etc. Linux, OpenSSL, Intel et al. have a moral duty in
     terms of security/privacy!
   - Learn privacy tools, improve them, etc.
   - Design and build useful crypto resources for the community
** 30. Conclusions
   Fundamental question is, is all this alarmist?

   - OpenSSL bugs
   - NSA surveillance programs
   - Juniper backdoors
   - Dual_EC_DRBG

   *Note LM*: looking at bugs found in the last decade and possible
   links with the NSA would make an interesting study.

   Interest in politics, quote.

   *Note LM*: from the talk's question session; it's impossible to
   determine the future, how does one go about deciding what is good and
   what is bad? Should we censor ourselves just because some work is
   bad? (i.e. in what sense does the precautionary principle work here?)
