#+TITLE: Computer and Network Security -- Lab 02
#+SUBTITLE: Assembly Language

Haven't had time to fill this in. Anyway, there's not much theory to go
around on.

As a general idea, the first two labs are ripe for an overhaul. Assembly
needs to be one of the first things being taught, and we need to take it
very easy if we're to not give it hard to students who aren't used to
it.

1. Simple system call [3p]
2. Looping math [3p]
3. Funny convention [4p]
4. Extra: obfuscation [1p]
5. Extra: platform-independent [1p]
