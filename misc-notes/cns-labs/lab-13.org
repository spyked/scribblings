#+TITLE: Computer and Network Security -- Lab 13
#+SUBTITLE: Advanced Binary Analysis

(This lab was made from scratch by yours truly, so I don't really feel
like adding anything to it in terms of explanations. Probably next
year...)

Symbolic execution high-level: it explores *execution paths* in a
program (or a representation of it) and it tries to find the
*conditions* under which a given *state* is *reachable*. For example, it
tries to answer the question "what inputs lead to a buffer overflow in
this program?"

* Tutorial: Symbolic Execution using angr [2p]
* Tasks
** 1. baby-re [3p]
** 2. hash [5p]
*** a. Solve by hand [2p]
*** b. Solve using angr [3p]
