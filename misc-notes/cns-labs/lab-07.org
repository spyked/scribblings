#+SUBTITLE: Exploiting. Shellcodes (Part 2)

* Tasks
** 1. Passing shellcode through env [3p]
   The task should be pretty straightforward. Use shellcraft to craft a
   fast shellcode, GDB with =pattc=/=patto= to find the offset of the
   target address, and =A=$(python -c 'print "A"*100000') ./getenv A= to
   get the shellcode's approximate address.

   Then, of course, profit.
** 2. Multistage exploit [7p]
*** a. Leak the buffer address [2p]
    A good start is to play with the binary and read digits at random
    offsets. The buffer's address should be found at offset 8, but a
    certain way to find this out is to write something at that offset
    before.

    So here's a way to automate this:

    #+BEGIN_SRC
    for d in range(0, some offset)
       write ref_message
       read digit d
       if d matches ref_message
          store leaked address and break
    #+END_SRC
*** TODO b. Construct the first stage [2p]
*** TODO c. Construct the second stage [3p]
